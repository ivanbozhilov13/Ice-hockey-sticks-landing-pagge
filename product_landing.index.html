                <h3>Wood, fiberglass, carbon fiber</h3>
                <p>Sticks have traditionally been made from wood, but in recent years, sticks made of more expensive materials such as aluminum, Aramid (kevlar), fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other composite materials have become common.</p>

            <div id="pricing">
                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>Hockey sticks cost between $30-$300 depending on the quality and design. Wood sticks are the cheapest, followed be composite and then carbon fiber sticks which are lighter and offer more powerful flex when shooting on net.</p>

                    <h4>Wooden sticks</h4>
                    <p>Wooden hockey sticks cost a fraction of what today's composite hockey sticks cost and still deliver solid performance. They make an excellent choice for younger players, as well as for those new to the game who really don't know what they want yetâ€”they're an affordable way to get on the ice with a stick that will do the job.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Fiberglass sticks</h4>
                    <p>Fiberglass was the first composite stick material, initially used with wood. Some sticks made solely from fiberglass have been produced but today, fiberglass is most commonly used as a composite with other materials, such as wood, carbon fiber, and/or kevlar.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Carbon fiber</h4>
                    <p>Carbon fiber has become by far the most common building material for sticks used in the NHL. Carbon fiber sticks were originally sold as shafts alone, much like their aluminum counterparts but nowadays, most hockey sticks are "one piece" sticks.</p>
